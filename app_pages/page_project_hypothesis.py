        f"globular in shape and have variable patterns of enhancement "
        f"regardless of whether they are benign or malignant. These "
        f"properties all have to be translated into machine learning terms "

        f"predict class outcomes on a dataset without adhering too closely to "
        f"that specific set of data. Therefore, the model is able to "
        f"effectively generalise and predict reliably on any future "
        f"observations. This can be achieved because the model didn't just "
        f"memorise the correlation between features and labels in the "

        f"labels."

    st.info(
        f"SoftMax and Sigmoid are both activation functions that are used in "
        f"an ML model architecture. Typically, SoftMax is used for "
        f"multi-class classification and Sigmoid is used for binary "

        f"solve our problem, both were tested and compared against each "
        f"other.\n\n"
        f"To obtain a conclusion about which activation function we should "
        f"use in our ML model, a learning curve can be plotted to show the "
        f"accuracy and error rate on the training and validation dataset as "
        f"the model is being trained.\n\n"
