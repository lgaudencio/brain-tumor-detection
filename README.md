## Dataset Content

The dataset contains a total of 3713 MRI scan images, in which they all consist of a single brain scan and all have a black background as all images are in black and white. These brain scan images are further broken down into 1923 healthy brain scans and 1789 scans of a brain in which a tumour is present. According to [Brain Tumour Research](https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/campaigning/stark-facts#:~:text=We%20understand%20the%20power%20of%20statistics&text=Too%20many%20people%20are%20being,diagnosed%20with%20a%20brain%20tumour) in the UK, 16,000 people each year are diagnosed with a brain tumour. The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset). 

## Business Requirements 

We have been tasked with developing a machine learning model to be able to detect the presence of brain tumours by using MRI scans. The requested system should be able to detect whether a given scan is healthy or has a tumour present, therefore altering medical staff that the patient needs further treatment. The system was requested by medical professionals to assist them in automating the detection of brain tumours. Medical professionals conduct thousands of brain MRI scans every year all across the country. As a result of this, a manual process is not scalable as more and more scans are being performed. 

The key stakeholders are: 

* Medical and healthcare professionals 
* Healthcare facilities, such as hospitals and clinics 
* Patients 
* Cancer research programs 

To summarise: 

* The client is interested in conducting a study to visualise the difference in MRI scans between a healthy brain and one with a tumour. 
* The client is interested in having a reliable and functional ML model to predict if an MRI scan of a brain has the absence or presence of a tumour. 
* The client is interested in having a dashboard at their disposal to obtain a prediction report of the examined MRI brain scans.
